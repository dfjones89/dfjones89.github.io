Hi, I'm Dave, a Software Engineer and Web Developer based in beautiful North Wales, UK

I've been working with Ruby (on and off Rails) since 2012 and I've been blessed to work on some amazing projects for the likes of [FreeAgent](https://www.freeagent.com) and [Bit Zesty](https://www.bitzesty.com).

I studied Internet Computer Science at [St Andrews](http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk){:target="_blank"} (BSc First-class Hons) and currently work as a Senior Ruby Developer at [EdgePetrol](https://edgepetrol.com){:target="_blank"}.

I like to help people through technology, building products and processes that improve people's lives.
