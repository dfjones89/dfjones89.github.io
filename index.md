Hi, I'm Dave, a Software Engineer and tech enthusiast based in Edinburgh, Scotland. I'm the author and maintainer of [Sheldon](https://github.com/dvjones89/sheldon){:target="_blank"}, an open-source dotfile manager written in Ruby.

I studied Internet Computer Science at [St Andrews](http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk){:target="_blank"} (first-class BSc Hons) and currently work as a Senior Support Engineer for [FreeAgent](https://www.freeagent.com){:target="_blank"}.

I like to help people over the internet, and sometimes over the phone.  
I play with Ruby (on and off Rails), Raspberry Pis and gadgets that fly in the sky.
