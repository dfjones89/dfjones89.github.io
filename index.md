Hi, I'm Dave, a 20-something tech enthusiast based in Edinburgh, Scotland.

I studied Computer Science at [St Andrews](http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk){:target="_blank"} and now work as a Senior Support Engineer for the awesome [FreeAgent](https://www.freeagent.com){:target="_blank"}.

I like to help people over the internet, and sometimes over the phone.  
I play with Ruby (on and off Rails), Raspberry Pis and gadgets that fly in the sky.
