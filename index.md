Hi, I'm Dave, a 20-something tech enthusiast based in Edinburgh, Scotland.

I studied Computer Science at [St Andrews](http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk){:target="_blank"} and now work as a Senior Support Engineer for the awesome [FreeAgent](http://www.freeagent.com){:target="_blank"}.

I'm a self-confessed radio/podcast geek with a passion for AV technology and broadcasting.  
I play with Ruby (on and off Rails), Raspberry Pis and mechanical keyboards.
