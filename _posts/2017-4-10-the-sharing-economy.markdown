A few months ago, I encountered a phrase I'd never heard of before, "The Sharing Economy".  
I stumbled across a Vlogger, [insert name] on YouTube, who lives a life working (and living) in The Sharing Economy, delivering food, running errands around the city, sleeping in communal accomodation. I find these videos strangely compelling - there's something liberating about a guy making his way through life with no pre-determined plan, no strings or attachments, leveraging new technologies to stay ahead of the rat-race.

As I understand it, The Sharing Economy captures a wave of new businesses that offer public services at cheaper prices, sharing the resources of the general public. The most obvious example is AirB&B, where a member of the public can rent their unused bedroom or property as a short-term holiday home.
This helps the property owner gain an income on otherwise unused space, whilst offering holiday makers a significantly cheaper accomodation option, compared to expensive corporate hotels.
Other examples are food delivery services like Uber Eats and Deliveroo, cyclists for whom are ten-a-penny in Edinburgh City Centre.

Last weekend I visited London, a city known for its expense and high cost of living. Staying only for a weekend, I travelled light with a backpack and small suitcase of clothes, though I didn't much fancy wheeling my case around for 12 hours on the final day. As most people do, I turned to Google for options - could I leave my bad at London Kings Cross for the day? Of course, there are baggage drop-off options at Kings Cross, but I suspected the stoage price would equate to the cost of the bag contents. Instead, I found another options, a startup called [CityStasher](https://www.citystasher.com), promising secure (insured) backage storage options at very affordable prices. I was able to leave my bag at a NISA Convenience Store, 5 minutes from Euston Station, for the price of Â£6. Brilliant.

After positive experiences with AirB&B, CityStasher and Uber, I've observed a shift in my thinking. I've traditionally been quite risk averse, sticking with "what I know" and using the "safer" corporate options - if you have a problem at a major hotel chain, you complain at the desk and it gets fixed, right? Those guarantees aren't afforded if you're staying in the spare room of a "stranger". In reality, I've come to realise how these larger chains are actually just branded buildings staffed by employees who often aren't getting the fair treatment they deserve. Would you **really** care that much about guest experience when you're working 12 hours shifts, paid minimum wage and operating on a zero-hour contract? Amazing, there *are* people who give incredible service under these conditions, and those people gain by utmost respect, thank you.
Back to my original point, those working in The Sharing Economy live and die by the service they give, and the reviews they subsquently receive from users. In return for providing a good service, people can pick their own workings hours, float between whichever platform offers them the best deal and generally exercise more control over their lives. That feels like a win for everyone.

Putting aside the economics, I think there's a second, much more important implication of The Sharing Economy; it forces us to trust people.  
I trusted the London Convenience Store to look after my bag. I trusted the flat owner in Portugal to meet with the key to his apartment for the weekend. So far, I haven't been hurt or let down by any of the people I've met. Infact, I've been amazed at the quality of service and generosity I've received. At a time when the news is typically bleak, when common sense seems scarce and fear-mongering is rife, I'm buoyed by the lovely people I've met and sense of community being forged.

I, for one, intend to double-down on the sharing economy, cutting out the middle-man and have more meaningful interactions with real people.
